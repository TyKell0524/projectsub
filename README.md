My name is Tyrin Kellum.

This is my first project submitted for my online schooling. I decided to create a resturant supplying different tastes from africa and the levant.

While it is just a website and not an actual resturant (as of yet possibly) browse it, look at the design, and give me feedback if you’d like. However the website is pretty straight forward with what you can access such as offering a homepage with three different buttons to access the menu, reservation, and contact us pages.

I utilized html and css mainly with a few JavaScript codes.

As stated above this is my very first project so there’s always room for improvement. I believe I could improve on responsiveness and animation. As well as understanding the coding language because to me it was a bit unclear specifically on what i needed to complete on this project.
